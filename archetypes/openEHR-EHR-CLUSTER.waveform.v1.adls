Details of the waveform start time and duration/interval should be stored in the parent OBSERVATION.

May be used to assess the quality of a measurement, as using a pulse plesmythography waveform to assess the accuracy of a pulse oximetry SpO2 measurement.
May also be used as part of a direct patient assessment, e.g. using a pulse plesmythography waveform for cardiac output estimation.">
